# Note from Afeez

Jacob, that programme runs smoothly! Now you can start learning Flask as a web framework. Do not worry, if you
have not finish LPTHW, since you can learn everything on the fly now. I would love to see your code for your first project soon!

You can cd into the directory that you git init this file and type 'git pull <your remote for github repo>'
